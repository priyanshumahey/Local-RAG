# Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input.

## Layers in Neural Networks

Neural networks consist of multiple layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
