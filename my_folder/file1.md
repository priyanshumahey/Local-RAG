# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
